2020 Interactive Graphics Project

This is a project I made for the Interactive Graphics course in Sapienza University of Rome in 2020.
This project depicts a game made with the Three.js library.

This is a game where the player is the student that is trying to complete their (Interactive Graphics) project assignment.
You have to manage your stamina and motivation, and deal with the upcoming "problems" in order to complete the project.

The Github Pages link for the game where you can try it:
